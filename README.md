# Calc

This is a simple pemdas calculator that only uses double precision floating 
points numbers, with the ability to store data in variables.

## Usage

Either run the calc binary as is to open a CLI (that you can exit by typing 
`exit`) or pass your formula as an argument to the program. Several instructions
can be separated by a semicolon `;`.

## Installation
