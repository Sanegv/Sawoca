Sanegv's WonderCalc is a simple pemdas calculator that (for now) only uses 
double precision floating points numbers, with the ability to store data in
 variables.

## Usage

Either run the calc binary as is to open a CLI (that you can exit by typing 
`exit`) or use the -h or --help flag to show the different options.

## Installation

Simply use the `make` command. The executable will be created as `build/swc`.
